## Things that need work
- don't commit all those intellij files
- tests?
- build system? (maven)
- complecting of system in with some of the modeling classes? (keep i/o at the fringes as much as possible)
- unused imports (Intellij helps you with this)
- unused variables (Intellij helps you with this)
- useless comments (no need to call out what the constructor is)
- wtf whitespace? (use Intellij's autoformatting)
- use type inference on generics when possible (IntelliJ helps you with that)
- make things that can be private actually private (Intellij, again, helps with that)

## Things that are good
- handling of ace's variable value in the getter is the exact reason why getters are a thing. Nice.
- actually playing the game is super legit. It is clear what is happening and fun to play. Ultimately, THIS IS ALL THAT MATTERS!!!!
